- 👋 Hi, I’m @michaelEspersen
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, XML and technologies related to web development and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning with Python, web development with Node.js.
- 💞️ I’m looking to explore as I cannot contribute much yet.
- 📫 I will probably respond at a glacial pace, but I'm here from time to time. Try michael.espersen2@gmail.com if you have oceans of patience only.
